This is the opposite yet quite similar to Amygdala's Rag Doll. One is about a sentient thing losing everything in front of a wired fence. The other is about a sentient thing getting their shit together in front of a wired fence.

I love how the comments on songs like The Distortionist are really deep and stuff, except the ones on this song are
"I need help making a chicken casserole"
"You can't escape the rice"
"Snail workout music"

I'm able to see your progress in mental state from the past and now, from hyperdontia, happy days, the distortionist, etc, to now, where we're sure it'll be better, and surely, you'll pick yourself back up again. It's amazing and I'm proud

I love how under other creators' songs about creepy/weird/cryptic stuff people are always trying to find the best interpretation, work together to understand the lyrics and here's just. Memes. Casseroles. Bug inside jokes. And that's why I'm subscribed
